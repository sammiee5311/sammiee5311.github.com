# Self Driving

### First Try

I tried to use a camera to detect the tape on the floor so that the machine can measure which direction has to be selected. <br>

First, I used a canny edge detector to change the image and then used a hough line transform to extract the feature of the line on the image.


### Second Try

### Thrid Try
