# Snake [(code)](https://github.com/sammiee5311/reinforcement_learning/tree/main/snake)

Firstly, I've used an observation as differences between coordinates of fruit and snake head. However, It was not working well this observation and also I wanted to try with deep learning with reinforcement learning. <br>

So I searched some of youtube videos that showed how to use CNN with q learning. There is [Python Enginner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXgNpp0jedKWcQiULLbDTA) Youtuber. <br>

I've learnt from him a lot about Deep Q Learning. So I refered to his code.
