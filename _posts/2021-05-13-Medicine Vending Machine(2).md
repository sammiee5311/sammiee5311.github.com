We used an Arduino Mega, a Raspberry Pi 4, motors, a microphone, a touch screen, and lots of cables. In order to control all the 7 motors, we had to manage voltage well. <br>

- First, we put 5v to the Raspberry Pi 4 and touch screen each. 
- Second, we put 5v to the Arduino mega and connect it to the Raspberry Pi 4 to control it.
- After that, we used one more 5v and put it on a breadboard with all motors to cover all the motors.

We finally manage to build a prototype of our machine. <br>

After few weeks, We've ordered acrylic plates so that the machine will be looked better. <br>

We had few issues which are a touchscreen issue, a motor issue, etc. The reason why a touchscreen issue was the worst issue is that we've tried to rotate the screen 90 degrees, but it does not work quite well. <br>

We could rotate the screen but not the touch calibrations in order to sync the screen location and the touch location. The Raspberry Pi 4â€™ booting was only available with CLI. So we have no choice to reformat the Raspberry Pi 4. <br>

In a Few days, The touchscreen worked very well. <br>


This is the result that builds with acrylic plates <br>
