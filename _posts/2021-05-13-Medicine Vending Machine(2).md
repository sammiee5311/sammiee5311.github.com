We used an Arduino Mega, a Raspberry Pi 4, motors, a microphone, a touch screen, and lots of cables. In order to control all the 7 motors, we had to manage voltage well. <br>

- First, we put 5v to the Raspberry Pi 4 and touch screen each. 
- Second, we put 5v to the Arduino mega and connect it to the Raspberry Pi 4 to control it.
- After that, we used one more 5v and put it on a breadboard with all motors to cover all the motors.

We finally manage to build a prototype of our machine. <br>

| This is the prototype. |
