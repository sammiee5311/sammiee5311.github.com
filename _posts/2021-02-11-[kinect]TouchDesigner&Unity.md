# Touchdesigner

I've bought a kinect recently. So I tried to use it with touchdesinger in order to make some cool effects.

Can't wait to see other effects with touchdesigner.

# Unity

After I watched [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_UIfFA77pk), I wanted to try to make a snake game which is 3 dimensions with Azure Kinect. <br>
