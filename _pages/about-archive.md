# HYEONG JUN AN 

- A software engineering student who is interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision. I have a knowledge of programming and deep learning in order to build a software. (4th year of university) <br>

## PROJECTS

+ ### Self-Driving Car (Sep 2020 – Nov 2020)
    - It decides a steering value by using Convolution Neural Network in order to drive itself.
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/raspberry_pi/tree/master/self_driving_car)
    - [diray 1](https://sammiee5311.github.io/raspi/Raspi-Self-Driving/) [diray 2](https://sammiee5311.github.io/raspi/raspi-Self-Driving(2)/)
    
    - #### Motivation
        - Among the rapid entry into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, self-driving cars are easily accessible and have many things to learn. <br>

+ ### find_missing_people (Sep 2020 – Nov 2020)
    - It is a program which is automatically finding missing people through the camera(ex. self-driving car).
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/find_missing_people)
    - (Use Django framework to make website and interact with it. In Progress)
    
    - #### Motivation 
        - There are a number of criminal activities nowadays, I wanted to make a program that make finding people easier. <br>

+ ### Facial Expression (Nov 2020)
    - A program that recommends some activities according to a person's expression like playing music.
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/facial_expression)

+ ### Recycling machine (Jan 2021)
    - A machine that automatically sorts out recyclables and then gives rewards to people.
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/capstone_design)
    - [diray](https://sammiee5311.github.io/capston/Global-Capstone-Design/)
    
    - #### Motivation
        - COVID-19 impacts on the recycling industry. Nowadays, a number of people order delivery food more than before due to the corona-virus. It is an important thing that people should recycle better for sustainable living.

+ ### 3 dimensions snake game (Jan 2021 - Feb 2021)
    - It is a game that is made easier for users to see the locations(x,y and z coordinates) of the fruit and the snake by using Azure Kinect.
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/3_dimensions_snake_game)
    
+ ### Medicine vending machine (Mar 2021 - Present)
    - It is a machine that allows people to get medicine at any time through a video call with pharmacists.
    - [to see code](https://github.com/sammiee5311/medicine_vending_machine)
    
    - #### Motivation
        - Many people complain about not only getting medicine at working hours but also hard to get it in underdeveloped areas.
